# Yoda

Yoda is a lightweight extention to GitHub (Cloud or Enterprise) for supporting Agile Project Management using GitHub issues. Yoda was developed as an internal tool inside Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and OpenSourced using an MIT license in 2018.
 

## Getting Started

To get started with Yoda is easy. There is no need to download or install it separately as you can run Yoda straight off GitHub via the [Yoda Landing Page](https://pages.github.com/github-yoda/yoda). 

In order to access issues in non-public repositories, you will need to set an appropriate personal GitHub Token. This is explained in the MANUAL linked via the landing page.

You can of course copy Yoda to your own Webserver, GitHub repository, or GitHub Enterprise. Simply get all the files in the `/docs` folder.


## Documentation

Documentation is available either via the Yoda landing page, or directly [here](docs/MANUAL.md).


## Running the tests

TODO: Right now, there is no automated testing for Yoda. Plan is to use [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).
